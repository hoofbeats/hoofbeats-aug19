In medicine, a few sayings will stand the test of time:
> "Common things are common."
> 
> "When you hear hoofbeats, think 'horses', not 'zebras'."

The focus here is to collectively improve the understanding of the commonalities in medicine. Our goal is to be the toolbox for managing the horses in healthcare.
